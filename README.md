# ClimbSim
This repository creates a robot climbing simulator that runs in pybullet. It can be used for teleoperation and also for reinforcement learning. The simulator is based on the robot, SCALER (Spine-enhanced Climbing Autonomous Legged Exploration Robot), from the Robotics and Mechanisms Laboratory at UCLA.)
