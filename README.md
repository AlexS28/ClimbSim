# ClimbSim
(WORK IN PROGRESS: TO BE RELEASED IN FULL FUNCTIONING SHAPE LATER THIS YEAR)
This repository creates a robot climbing simulator that runs in pybullet. It can be used for teleoperation and also for reinforcement learning. The simulator is based on the robot, SCALER (Spine-enhanced Climbing Autonomous Legged Exploration Robot), from the Robotics and Mechanisms Laboratory at UCLA - see reference below.

SCALER: A Tough Versatile Quadruped Free-Climber Robot by Yusuke Tanaka, Yuki Shirai, Xuan Lin, Alexander Schperberg, Hayato Kato, Alexander Swerdlow, Naoya Kumagai, and Dennis Hong.
