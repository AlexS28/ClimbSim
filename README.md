# ClimbSim
(WORK IN PROGRESS) 
# --- Expect repo update around March 2023 ---
# First update: Teleoperation for a climbing robot (~March)
# Second update: Planner for a climbing robot using reinforcement learning (~June)
This repository creates a robot climbing simulator that runs in pybullet, and can be used with an Xbox controller for teleoperation. The simulator is based on the robot, SCALER (Spine-enhanced Climbing Autonomous Legged Exploration Robot), from the Robotics and Mechanisms Laboratory at UCLA - see reference [2] below. The paper on the simulator and use of reinforcement learning using this simulator will be written in citation [1] (currently work in progress)
